Reinforced Learning agent on Snake game environment 
Recently I have finished the RL specialization at Coursera, by AMII and University of Alberta. 
Still not sure if I would recommend taking this specialization. However, I’ve decided to build a small portfolio project for myself, to get some confidence in studied material.
So I’ve designed this Snake environment, modeled the action-value function with shallow NN, and wrapped all this with Expected SARSA RL agent. 
Got this performance after some training period: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michael-lagutin-9b6a6bab_reinforcementlearning-machinelearningalgorithms-activity-6751185597332783104-3nkP

Its very satisfying to observe how the algorithm studies and its performance improves, while it is playing the game.
